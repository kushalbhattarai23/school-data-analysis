## 📋 Dataset

The project uses student performance data stored in `data/student.csv`. This dataset likely contains information about:
- Student demographics
- Academic performance metrics
- Course enrollment data
- Assessment scores
- Other educational indicators

## 🔧 Requirements

To run this analysis, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common data analysis libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy (if statistical analysis is performed)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd school-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the analysis notebook**
   - Navigate to `school-data-analysis.ipynb`
   - Run the cells to execute the analysis
